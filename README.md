# iTunes⇄Discord
An app for macOS and Windows to automatically set the activity on Discord to the currently played music on iTunes

#### This app is not finished so I don't recommend you to use it for the moment

# How to run it ?
You need NodeJS 8.0.0+ (older versions untested), macOS 10.10+/Windows 7+ and Electron to use it. Just install the dependencies and... run it!
    
       $ npm install
       $ npm i electron -G
       $ npm start
       
       
# How to build it ?
You need [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to build iTunes-Discord:
       
       $ npm i electron-builder -G
       $ npm run dist
       
       
# Contribute!

You can easily contribute by translating the application into more languages! Just copy the english.json file, rename it to the language you're translating to and... translate!
